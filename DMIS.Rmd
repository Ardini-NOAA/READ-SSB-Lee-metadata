## Linking to Veslog

Linking to VESLOG with DMIS DOCID has a few issues. (Chad Demarest, May 14, 2020)
1.  JML adds digits to DMIS DOCID to denote subtrips.
1.  Another is that some data handling protocols (varies by file type) truncate a digit off the end of the EVTR serial numbers.
1.  A third is that DMIS will Give positive (mostly correct) matchâ€™s where the DOCID fails for these and other reasons.
